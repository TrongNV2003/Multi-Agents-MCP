Start MCP SSE server:
```python
python mcp_server.py
```

mongoDB:

python main.py
```

Running Multi Agents with UI:
```python
python -m streamlit run interface/gui.py
```

## Future plans
- Applying MCP (Model Context Protocol) for flexible plug-and-play external tools and APIs. (Done)
- Applying A2A (Agent to Agent Protocol) for Agents able to interact with each other.
- Build UI for users easy to interact with Multi Agents. (Done)
